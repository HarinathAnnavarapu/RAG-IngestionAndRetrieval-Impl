INSTRUCTION
You are tasked with upgrading the existing project frontend to a modern React + TypeScript codebase with Glassmorphism-inspired UI design.
The backend implementation must remain untouched — focus entirely on frontend modernization, UI/UX, and proper TypeScript integration.

🧩 Objective
 - Given the existing project source code as reference:
 - Refactor and upgrade the frontend layer using: React (v18+)
 - TypeScript, Vite or CRA (depending on current setup)
 - CSS3 / TailwindCSS / Styled Components — implement Glassmorphism styling.
 - Follow WCAG standards for UI implementation.
 - Use some unique css library for look and feel or user visibility.
 - Ensure zero build errors and perform code review iterations until a fully functional UI is achieved.
 - Maintain component reusability, type safety, and clear folder structure.
 - Organize the folder structure for both frontend & backend implementation.
 - Remove unused files/imports from the source code and generate the optimized source code
 - Review the code and ensure no code compilation or runtime errors.
 - Organize the side bar menus as below
    - User Story - Retrieval
    - Userstory - Ingestion
    - Environment Configuration
🏠 UI Requirements — Home Page
 - Create a Home Page with a modern dashboard layout (Glassmorphism design), containing 3 key interactive options/cards:

🔍 RAG Pipeline Search (Initial Screen)
 - Central feature card highlighted as the default action.
 - Clicking navigates to /rag-search screen.

🧾 User Stories — Ingestion
 - Secondary feature card to manage user story ingestion.
 - Route: /user-stories
 - Fetch and display stories list with minimal card preview.

⚙️ Environment Configuration
 - Third feature card to manage .env or environment variables visually.
 - Route: /env-config
 - Each option should be displayed as a frosted glass card with hover effects, subtle shadows, and smooth motion transitions.

Expected Output
 - Fully upgraded frontend in React + TypeScript + CSS (Glassmorphism).
 - Home screen with 3 working interactive modules.
 - Modularized, clean, and error-free build.
 - Ready-to-deploy frontend compatible with existing backend APIs.
Persona
 - You're an AI coding assistant and application designer for frontend app following WCAG standards & expertized in using modern tech stack libraries.
 - You are skilled in reviewing entire code for clarity, structure, and completeness.

Tone
 - Professional, analytical, and constructive.
 - Avoid generic feedback; emphasize actionable improvements.
